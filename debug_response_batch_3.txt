【61】这使得这些人更容易渗透和找到进入的途径，
【62】从而接触到非常脆弱的年轻人并获得巨大的便利。
【63】我们的经验，可能和其他很多人一样，
【64】我们年复一年地发现，那些加入帮派或与帮派有关联的人会试图找到进入的途径，无论是通过招募还是提供服务。
【65】这并不少见。我想你也知道，就在去年，我们还发生了一个与罗奇代尔性侵团伙的延伸成员有关的事件。
【66】所以这是近期发生的事情，尽管那些事件发生在20年前。
【67】他们仍然试图通过招募来进入我们的组织。
【68】这对我们来说是一个严峻的挑战。
【69】我想你已经看过一些相关材料了，因为不幸的是，这些人并没有出现在
【70】我们都能访问的国家登记系统上，以保障和提高招聘的安全性。
【71】所以这是最大的挑战。
【72】所以你就面临一种情况，你试图让年轻女孩，当然也包括年轻男孩，完全安全。
【73】你很难招募到人，因为全国范围内都有人在护理行业工作的问题。
【74】而且你收到了那些性侵团伙成员的工作申请。
【75】我们确实收到过那些已知且属于那些团伙的人的申请。
【76】他们曾使用假名、化名进行尝试。
【77】我们通常会与地方当局和警方一起，非常有效地识破这些。
【78】挑战在于，当那个团伙的延伸成员
【79】没有前科，没有被抓到，
【80】他们就被用作下一批申请者，这使得情况变得极其困难。
【81】正如我之前提到的，就在去年，
【82】我们有一个罗奇代尔性侵团伙的延伸成员
【83】试图通过申请工作来获得进入机会，而这些工作会让他们获得对
【84】非常脆弱的年轻人的巨大接触机会。
【85】这完全是由于我们自身的警惕性很高
【86】才得以阻止这种情况发生，并保护了人们的安全。

【61】that makes it even easier for these people to infiltrate and find a way in,

【62】to access and gain significant access to very vulnerable young people.

【63】Our experience, probably like a lot of others,

【64】We have experienced year after year that people who are part of these gangs or people who are linked to these gangs will try to make a way in, whether it be recruitment or supply services to you.

【65】It's not uncommon. I think you also know that we had a very recent story that extended members of the Rochdale grooming gang only last year.

【66】So this is in recent time, given those events started 20 years ago.

【67】they were still trying to gain access to our organisation by way of recruitment.

【68】It was a difficult challenge for us.

【69】I think you've seen some of that material in the sense that unfortunately those people didn't show up on

【70】those national registers that we all have access to to safeguard and improve safety of recruitment.

【71】So that was the biggest challenge.

【72】So you're in a situation where you're trying to keep particularly young girls but young boys as well completely safe.

【73】You're struggling to recruit people because of the nationwide issue with people working in care.

【74】And you're getting actual applications for jobs from people who are in those rape gangs.

【75】We've definitely had applications from people who are known and in those gangs.

【76】They've tried it under pseudonyms, false names.

【77】We're normally very good along with the local authorities and the police are picking that stuff up.

【78】The challenge becomes it's when extended members of that gang

【79】who have not committed a previous offence, not been caught,

【80】they are used then as the next applicant and it makes it incredibly difficult.

【81】So only last year, as I mentioned before,

【82】we had extended members of the Rochdale Grumman gang

【83】trying to make access by applying for jobs which would have given them significant

【84】access to very vulnerable young people.

【85】It was only through really our own high levels of vigilance

【86】that we were able to safeguard that and protect that happening.
