61. 我相信你做到了。

62. 你们为自己感到骄傲吗？

63. 我们合作得很愉快。

64. 我们就这样抓到了 BBC。

65. 我们有很好的线人。

66. 坦白说，恭喜你们。

67. 你们为很多国家、很多伟大的人类提供了出色的服务，如果你想知道的话。

68. 揭露了什么才是大新闻，BBC 做了什么。

69. 没人会想到这种事，先生。我实际上改了我说的话。

70. 所以 BBC 道歉并撤回了报道，但他们说不会赔偿？

71. 好吧，我们要告他们。我们可能会在下周，向他们索赔十亿到五十亿美元。

72. 所以你真的在说，嗯，我想我必须这么做。我是说，他们甚至承认他们作弊了。

73. 我是说，不是说他们不可能那样做。

74. 他们作弊了。

75. 他们改了我口中的话。

76. 这比 CBS 对待喀布尔还要糟糕。

77. 他们改了她的回答，但至少她的回答简短，你知道，从她嘴里说出来的。

78. 你认为英国电视观众仅为了看电视就支付超过 200 美元是否合适？

79. 你认为执照费……

80. 嗯，我不知道他们在一个我喜欢的地方，大体上是英国，对吧？

81. 但正如你所想象的，英国人民对发生的事情非常愤怒。

82. 因为这表明 BBC 是大新闻。

83. 你我早就知道了。

84. 但我们不知道是在这周。

85. 你是否向 Secure Stopper 提出过这个问题？

86. 我没有，但我周末会联系他。

87. 他actually给我打了电话。

88. 他对此感到非常尴尬。

89. 你知道，那——我不知道那个国家拥有多少股份。

90. 但无论股份是少是多，还是没有——

61. I am sure you did.

62. Are you proud of yourselves?

63. We've had a good company.

64. We catch BBC like that.

65. We have good sources.

66. Honestly, congratulations.

67. You've had a great service to a lot of countries, a lot of great human beings, if you want to know that you're in there.

68. Explosing what big news is all about, what BBC did.

69. Nobody would even think of anything like that, Mr. I actually changed the words coming out of my mouth.

70. So the BBC has apologized and retracted the report, but they say they won't pay compensation?

71. Well, we'll sue them. We'll sue them for anywhere between a billion and $5 billion, probably sometime next week.

72. So you're really saying, well, I think I have to do it. I mean, they've even admitted that they cheated.

73. I mean, not that they couldn't have not done that.

74. They cheated.

75. They changed the words coming out of my mouth.

76. That's worse than what CBS did with Kabul.

77. They change her answer, but at least it is short, you know, coming out of her mouth.

78. Do you think it's appropriate that British TV viewers have to pay more than $200 just for the height of the watch television?

79. Do you think the license...

80. Well, I don't know what they do in a place that I like a lot, the general UK, right?

81. But the people of the UK are very angry about what happened, as you can imagine.

82. Because it shows the BBC is big news.

83. It was — you and I knew that for a long time.

84. But we didn't know it was this week.

85. Have you raised the issue with Secure Stopper?

86. I have not, but I'm called over the weekend.

87. He actually put a call in to me.

88. He's very embarrassed by it.

89. You know, that's — I don't know what percentage is owned by the country.

90. But regardless of whether it's small or large or nothing —
