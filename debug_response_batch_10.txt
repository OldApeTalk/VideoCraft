271. 我对她一无所知。

272. 所有这些文件真是太糟糕了。

273. 或者她可以拥有，他们可以拥有他们想要的任何东西。

274. 他们已经有了。我认为他们已经有15,000页了。听着，这是民主党的骗局。这是

275. 民主党搞出的骗局。还有几个共和党人也跟着做了，因为

276. 他们软弱无能。但这是民主党的一个骗局，目的是转移他们刚刚

277. 输掉停摆和选举的注意力。他们输给了我，在一场创纪录的选举中输得很惨。

278. 他们输掉了普选票。

279. 他们输了，正如摇摆州所说，他们失去了一切。

280. 我认为是312比20多。

281. 所以这是不谈论这件事的一种方式。

282. 这是个骗局。

283. 这和“通俄门”没什么两样。

284. 而且是由民主党人和一些非常软弱的共和党人领导的。

285. 我只是想知道你有没有时间表，什么时候可能会公布更多这些文件

286. 因为民主党人仍然看到了

287. 嗯，我不知道这个，因为我对此一无所知，但我听说他们已经公布了

288. 大约4万到5万页了。

289. 而且他们已经打开了。

290. 我要这么说。

291. 如果他们有任何东西，他们会在选举前就用掉了。

292. 好吗？

293. 我不能告诉你他们选举后放了什么。

294. 但如果他们有什么东西，你难道不认为他们会在选举前就用掉吗？

295. 他们会乐于在选举前就用掉的。

296. 所以你在说选举。

297. 詹妮弗·戈德。

298. 或者你的团队为什么会鼓励……

299. Gover 代表和 Bates 代表为什么没有追求那个？

300. 因为我们认为谈论这件事不好，因为它转移了共和党人做得有多好的话题。

271. I know nothing about her.

272. What a piece of all the files are.

273. Or she can have, they can have whatever they want.

274. They already do. I think they have 15,000 pages already. Look, this is a Democrat hoax. This is a

275. hoax put out by the Democrat. And a couple of few Republicans have gone along with it because

276. they're weak and ineffective. But this is a Democrat hoax to get away from the fact that they just

277. lost the shutdown and they've lost the elections. They've lost the big election to me in a record number of

278. They lost the popular vote.

279. They lost, as the swing says, they lost everything.

280. I think it was 312 to 20 something.

281. So this is a way of not talking about that.

282. It's a hoax.

283. This is no different than Russia, Russia, Russia.

284. And it's headed up by Democrats and some very weak Republicans.

285. I was just wondering if you have a timeline for when you might release more of those files

286. because Democrats still have seen the

287. Well, I don't know about this because I know nothing about it, but I understand they released

288. like 40 or 50,000 pages already.

289. And they opened it up.

290. I will say this.

291. If they had anything, they would have used it before the election.

292. Okay?

293. I can't tell you what they put in since the election.

294. But if they had anything, you don't think they would have used it before the election.

295. They would have gladly used it before the election.

296. So you're speaking of the election.

297. Jennifer God.

298. Or why was your team encouraging...

299. Congressman Gover and Congresswoman Bates did not pursue that?

300. Because we think it's bad to talk about it because it gets away from the subject of how well the Republicans are doing.
