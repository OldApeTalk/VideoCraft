31. 这一切都是在我们总统和国务卿的帮助下完成的。

32. 奥巴马政府仅用了几天时间就回复了伊斯兰主义者的这封要求信，

33. 承诺成立一个由这些同一组织组成的特别工作组，立即开始对我们反恐培训进行这种前所未有的清除

34. 在每一个联邦机构中。

35. 这是令人震惊的，前所未有。

36. 但当国会议员，包括我在内，开始询问是谁

37. 在我们政府中领导这次清除行动，以及他们

38. 要从我们的培训材料中清除什么时，奥巴马政府告诉我们这些信息

39. 是保密的。

40. 它是被列为机密的。

41. 我们不知道是谁在幕后操纵这一切。

42. 我在这里要说，我的朋友们，我们现在游戏已经进行到很晚了。

43. 我们正在迅速失去我们作为一个国家的身份认同，并且正在失去识别我们激进伊斯兰敌人的能力。

44. 现在是本周不羞愧地为我们的自由和价值观而战，并为我们在世界各地的敌人划出一条明确的红线的时候了。

31. And all done with the help of our President and Secretary of State.

32. It took only days for the Obama administration to reply to this demand letter from the Islamists,

33. promising to set up a task force with these same organizations to immediately begin this unprecedented purge of our counterterrorism training

34. in every federal agency across the board.

35. It's breathtaking, never been done before.

36. But when members of Congress, myself included, started to ask questions about the identities

37. of who these people were who were leading this purge in our government and what it was they

38. were purging from our training materials, the Obama administration told us the information

39. was closed.

40. It was classified.

41. We couldn't know who was behind this.

42. I'm here to say, my friends, that we're now today very late in the game.

43. We're quickly losing our sense of who we are as a nation, and we're losing our ability to identify our radical Islamist enemy.

44. The time has come to stand unashamedly this week for our freedom and our values and draw an unmistakable red line for our enemies across the world.
