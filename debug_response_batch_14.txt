391. 你的故事就是这样的。

392. 我做了核磁共振。

393. 医生说这是他作为医生所见过的最好的结果。

394. 就是这样。

395. 但我做核磁共振是我年度例行体检的一部分。

396. 或者每两年一次，我想我每两年做一次，但我每年都体检。

397. 结果非常出色。

398. 是你的大脑吗？

399. 还是你的心脏？

400. 你可能知道，我不知道他们分析了什么，但无论他们分析了什么，

401. 他们分析得很彻底，他们说我的结果是他们见过的最好的。

402. 好了，我做的另一件事是，正如你所知，我做了一个

403. 非常非常先进的心理敏锐度测试，因为我认为总统应该这样做。

404. 而且你可能已经听说了，我通过了。我得了满分。我得了最高分。我得了

405. 满分。我告诉你这些的唯一原因是因为这是个可以让你摆脱烦恼的一件事，不像拜登和其他人

406. 你可以从你的飞机上脱掉。关于核试验的问题，这个问题非常具体，

407. 你是说你想？是关于核弹头吗？你

408. 我不想告诉你，但我们会像其他国家一样进行核试验。

409. 我们拥有比任何其他国家都多的核武器，所以我们必须进行试验。

410. 其他国家没有爆炸。

411. 你认为你会在接下来的选举中走上街头吗？

412. 哦，是的，我会帮助人们。

413. 好的。

414. 我会在街上帮助人们。

415. 对不起，但中期选举非常重要。

416. 再次，我认为我们应该废除阻挠议事制度。

418. 如果他们一旦被阻止，民主党人会这么做。

419. 立即。

420. 没有了曼钦和西内玛，他们本可以做得最好。

391. Here's what your story is.

392. I had an MRI.

393. The doctor said it was the best result he has ever seen as a doctor.

394. That's it.

395. But I had an MRI as part of my standard yearly MRI.

396. or every, I think I do it every two years, but I have the physical every year.

397. And the result was outstanding.

398. Is it your brain?

399. Or your heart?

400. You could know, I have no idea what they analyzed, but whatever they analyzed,

401. they analyzed it well, and they said that I had as good a result as they've ever seen.

402. Now, the other thing I took is I took, as you know, a

403. advanced, very advanced test on mental acuity because I think a president should have to do that.

404. And as you probably heard, I aced it. I got a perfect score. I got the highest score. I got a

405. perfect score. And the only reason I tell you that is it's one subject unlike Biden and others

406. that you can take off your plane. The question on nuclear testing, this being very specific,

407. are you saying you want to? It's a little bit of warhead? You

408. I don't want to tell you about that, but we will do nuclear testing like other countries do.

409. We have more nuclear weapons than any other country that we have to test.

410. Other countries are not exploding for this.

411. You think you'll get on the road for the next election?

412. Oh yeah, I'll be helping people.

413. Okay.

414. I'll be on the road helping people.

415. Sorry, but the midterms are very important.

416. And again, I think we should terminate the filibuster.

417. Republicans should terminate the filibuster.

418. The Democrats would do it.

419. immediately if they ever got bound.

420. And without mansion and cinema, they would have done it the best.
