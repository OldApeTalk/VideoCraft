121. 再加上我们国家极其富裕的事实

122. 我们没有战争，我们再次尊重它，

123. 再加上中国曾威胁我们的事实

124. 在稀土方面，我能解决它

125. 仅仅是通过对中国加征关税

126. 然后我们在一周后达成了一项协议。

127. 当你加上所有这些好处时，

128. 我们现在最大的优势就是关税的使用。

129. 我好好利用了它们。

130. 多年来，它们一直被用来对付我们。

131. 我认为，你知道，无论你称它们为关税还是其他什么，

132. 如果你不使用它们，你真的会无所顾忌。

133. 遭受灾难。

134. 那 2000 美元的付款，会通货膨胀吗？

135. 因为此前共和党人曾表示，这相当于在拜登治下向人们输送金钱。

136. 嗯，区别在于这是赚来的钱，而不是凭空捏造的钱。

137. 你知道，那些钱是凭空捏造的。

138. 拜登推出了《通胀削减法案》，但并未削减通胀，而且也不是

139. 打算这么做。

140. 他们也承认这是一个虚假的名称。

141. 当他们花数百亿美元购买一项名为《通胀削减法案》的银行交易时，

142. 那是凭空捏造的钱。当我给每人支付 2000 美元时

143. 面向低收入、中低收入和中等收入人群。富人除外，所有人都能拿到。这不是凭空捏造的

144. 的。这是真金白银。它们来自其他国家，是的。说起中国，既然你已经

145. 达成了交易，自你与他们达成交易以来，中国人是否需要实际购买

146. 大豆？他们是否锁定了任何大豆？是的，他们正在这么做。

147. 我们今天和他们谈过了。他们正在做的不仅仅是

148. 一点点，他们会大量购买大豆。

149. 你知道什么时候，春天吗？

150. 就在那时。我想就在那时。

121. When you add the fact that our country is extremely rich

122. and we have no wars and we respect it again,

123. when you add the fact that when China was threatening to us

124. in terms of rare earths, I was able to solve it

125. just by putting tariffs on China

126. and we made a deal a week later.

127. When you add all of the benefits,

128. The single greatest thing we have right now is the use of tariffs.

129. And I used them properly.

130. For years, they've been used against us.

131. And I think, you know, whether you call them tariffs or anything else,

132. if you didn't use them, you really would have it unguarded.

133. disaster against.

134. Will those $2,000 payments, will that be inflationary?

135. Because previously Republicans had said it's sending money to people like under Biden.

136. Well, the difference is this is money earned as opposed to money that was made up.

137. You know, that money was made up.

138. Biden gave like the Inflation Reduction Act, which did not reduce inflation and it wasn't

139. meant to.

140. And they admitted it was a phony name.

141. When they spend hundreds of billions of dollars on a bank deal called the Inflation Reduction Act,

142. that was made up money. When I pay people $2,000 each for

143. low and moderate income and middle income people. Everybody but the rich get this. That's not made

144. up. That's real money. That comes from other countries, yeah. Speaking of China, since you've

145. made the deals, since you struck the deal with them, is the Chinese need to actually purchase

146. any soybeans? Have they locked in any soybean? Yeah, and they're in the process of doing it.

147. We spoke to them today. They're in the process of doing not only

148. a little bit, but they'll be doing a lot of soybean purchase.

149. Do you know when in the spring?

150. It's starting. Before then, I think before then.
