【121】我们希望看到纽约一切顺利。

【122】几年前，您自己曾与尼克·昆汀（Nick Quentes）在海湖庄园共进晚餐。

【123】他应该在保守派运动中扮演什么角色？

【124】嗯，我不知道他要来，而且当时和他在一起的是，如您所知，某个名人，侃爷（Kanye）。

【125】侃爷（Kanye）昨天可以一起吃饭，他还带来了尼克（Nick）。

【126】当时我还不认识尼克（Nick）。

【127】他确实来了，还带了另外几个人。

【128】他带了几个人和他一起来。

【129】会见人们，与像塔克（Tucker）这样的人交谈。

【130】他们就是这么做的。

【131】你知道，有些人很有争议。

【132】有些人有，有些人没有。

【133】我不算有争议，我喜欢这样。

【134】委内瑞拉，你难道不和国会打交道吗？

【135】我想让国会继续参与进来。

【136】我的意思是，我们正在阻止——

【137】毒贩和毒品进入我们的国家。

【138】事实上，我告诉了马可（Marco）和一些人，

【139】我们（我国）的国务卿做得非常出色，顺便说一句。

【140】我说，去国会告诉他们，我们不会让毒品通过墨西哥进来。

【141】我们不会让它们通过委内瑞拉进来，让国会知道这件事。

【142】我们不一定需要他们的批准，但我认为让他们知道是件好事。

【143】我唯一不希望他们做的是泄露非常重要和机密的信息

【144】并且可能危及我们的军队或正在执行任务的人员，你知道，中央情报局、军队等等。

【145】但我确实说了，我说去见国会，去见我们应该见的代表们，

【146】并对此保持开放态度。

【147】如果他们说，我们不希望你阻止毒品进入这个国家，我认为那不好，是的。

【148】我们得到了很好的支持，因为这完全是为了毒品。

【149】嗯，在委内瑞拉的情况下，这关乎毒品，也关乎……

【150】成千上万，数十万被他们释放到我国的人。

【121】We want to see everything work out well for New York.

【122】You yourself had dinner with Nick Quentes at Mar-a-Lago a few years ago.

【123】What role should he play in the conservative movement?

【124】Well, I didn't know he was coming, and he was with, as you know, somebody, Kanye.

【125】And Kanye yesterday could have dinner, and he brought Nick.

【126】I didn't know Nick at the time.

【127】And he did. He came along with a few other people.

【128】He brought a few people with him.

【129】meeting people, talking to people like for somebody like Tucker.

【130】That's what they do.

【131】You know, people are controversial.

【132】Some are, some aren't.

【133】I'm not controversial, so I like it that way.

【134】Venezuela, aren't you with Congress?

【135】I'd like to keep Congress involved.

【136】I mean, we're stopping –

【137】drug dealers and drugs from coming into our country.

【138】And I actually told Marco and some of the people,

【139】our Secretary of State is doing a great job, by the way.

【140】I said, go to Congress and let them know we're not letting drugs come through Mexico.

【141】We're not letting them come through Venezuela and let Congress know about it.

【142】We don't have to get their approval, but I think letting them know is good.

【143】The only thing I don't want them to do is leak information that's very important and confidential

【144】and may put our military at risk or whoever is doing, you know, CIA, military, etc.

【145】But I did say, I said go and see Congress, see the representatives that we're supposed to be seeing,

【146】and be open about it.

【147】If they say, we don't want you to stop drugs from coming into the country, I don't think that would be good, yes.

【148】We have great support because it's all about drugs.

【149】Well, in Venezuela's case, it's about drugs and it's also about...

【150】thousands, hundreds of thousands of people that they've released into our country.
