1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:10,200
Another factor in understanding this administration's policy of appeasement is its relationship with an organization you may not have heard of before,

2
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:15,740
one of the largest, most powerful organizations in the world, and you should know its name.

3
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:24,900
It's called the Organization for Islamic Cooperation, Organization for Islamic Cooperation, OIC, and so far it's gone virtually unnoticed.

4
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:33,200
Who are they? The OIC is the second largest intergovernmental organization in the world after the United Nations.

5
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:42,240
The OIC claims they have authority to represent all Muslims, even those who live in non-Muslim countries like the United States.

6
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:52,000
In 2005, this very influential Islamic organization published a 10-year plan of action in 2005

7
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:57,020
to implement its Sharia-based speech code requirements worldwide.

8
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,420
Listen very carefully to what I'm telling you right now.

9
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,120
It explains this week.

10
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:10,140
They had a 10-year plan of action to implement their Sharia-based, Islamist-based speech code requirements worldwide.

11
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,900
But don't take my word for it.

12
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,820
They published this plan on their website in English so no one would miss their intent.

13
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:24,220
They intend to internationally criminalize all communication or any communication or speech

14
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,520
that's deemed by them to be insulting to Islam.

15
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,340
even in countries like the United States.

16
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,060
That, my friends, explains the story of this week.

17
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,320
Islamic-enforced speech codes,

18
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,080
no one, not Muslims, not non-Muslims,

19
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,400
not Americans are allowed to say anything Islamists see

20
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,400
as insulting to their religion.

21
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:56,360
They intend to force us to kiss our freedom of speech and religion goodbye,

22
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,620
And that's why we're being forewarned today.

23
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:12,580
Unbelievably, last December they succeeded with both President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's help

24
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:19,320
because they pushed through the United Nations the passage of UN Resolution 1618,

25
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:25,740
which called upon all countries to enact laws preventing derogatory references to Islam.

26
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:30,480
A clear violation of our First Amendment freedom of speech.

27
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:48,480
And even before that, in October, last October, many prominent Islamic organizations wrote a letter to the White House where they urged our White House to do a complete purge of any federal training materials from references to the ideology of Islam.

28
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:58,100
to ensure that all trainers in our U.S. military, our FBI, and other U.S. security agencies be retrained

29
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:03,960
so they would be brainwashed in political correctness toward Islam.

30
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:09,260
That's enforced Islamic speech codes here in the United States.

31
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,080
而这一切都是在我们总统和国务卿的帮助下完成的。

32
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:19,200
奥巴马政府仅用了几天时间就回复了伊斯兰主义者的这封要求信，

33
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:27,820
并承诺与这些组织成立一个特别工作组，立即开始对我们的反恐培训进行前所未有的清洗

34
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,240
覆盖所有联邦机构。

35
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,120
真是令人震惊，前所未有。

36
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:40,680
但当国会议员，包括我在内，开始询问是谁

37
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,060
在我们的政府中领导这次清洗，以及他们

38
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:51,580
从我们的培训材料中清洗了什么，奥巴马政府告诉我们这些信息

39
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,380
是保密的。

40
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,240
是机密的。

41
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,500
我们不能知道是谁在幕后操纵。

42
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:02,960
我的朋友们，我在这里说，我们现在已经很晚了。

43
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:13,660
我们正在迅速失去作为国家的自我认同感，并且正在失去识别我们激进伊斯兰敌人的能力。

44
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:24,460
现在是本周，为了我们的自由和价值观，我们应该毫不羞耻地站出来，并为我们世界各地的敌人划下一条明确的红线。
