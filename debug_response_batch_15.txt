421. 你是否愿意支持某人在初选时，比如玛乔丽·泰勒·格林，考虑到她最近的言论？

422. 嗯，这取决于谁来竞选。

423. 我的意思是，我不再是她的粉丝了，因为我不同意她的政策。

424. 当她说，你知道，去外国，带回数万亿美元并不重要的时候。

425. 你认为我想去坐飞机...

426. 20个小时，你们有些人和我一起，确切地说22个小时，旅行，然后下飞机发表演讲

427. 并让人们在我们国家投资数千亿美元。

428. 我宁愿不这么做，但如果你不去，你就无法

429. 取得那样的结果。

430. 举个例子，马来西亚，如果你看看泰国，我在泰国和柬埔寨停止了战争。

431. 如果我没去那个地区，我本可以去那个地区。

432. 我可能就无法停止那场战争。

433. 那场战争在生命代价上将是极其昂贵的，

434. 但即使对我们来说也是昂贵的。

435. 那么，你下周会见我们吗？

436. 你下周圣诞节会见议员们，大迪安娜吗？

437. 我不知道，我可能…

438. 我不知道。

439. 他们会。

440. 我猜他们正在决定是否

441. 要多赢得共和党。

442. 再多一两个。

443. 顺便说一句，我得说一句。

444. 我听说要再多一两个席位。

445. 我听说

446. 一场大诉讼将要发生，将要发生，涉及加州的骗局

447. 他们试图再赢五个席位。而加州是有史以来最不诚实的选举之一。

448. 他们向各地人们寄出数百亿美元的选票。很多人

449. 收到两三张选票，然后寄回。加州在投票方面是个耻辱。

450. 他们正在做一件非常非法的事情。

421. Would you be open to endorsing someone in the primary Marjorie Taylor Green giving her latest statements?

422. Well, it depends on who runs against them.

423. I mean, I'm no longer much of a fan, as I disagree with her policy.

424. When she said that, you know, going to foreign countries, bringing back trillions of dollars is not important.

425. Do you think I want to go and be on an airplane for...

426. 20 hours, some of you were with me, 22 hours to be exact, travel, and then get off and make

427. a speech and get people to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in our country.

428. I'd rather do it without having to go, but if you didn't go, you wouldn't be able to

429. have that kind of result.

430. As an example, Malaysia, if you look at Thailand, I stopped the war in Thailand and Cambodia.

431. If I didn't go to that region, I'd be able to go to that region.

432. I probably wouldn't have been able to stop that war.

433. That war would have been very costly in terms of lives,

434. but even costly in terms of us.

435. So are you meeting with us next week?

436. Are you meeting with lawmakers, Big Diana, next week on Christmas?

437. Not that I know if I might be.

438. I don't know.

439. They will.

440. I guess they're making a decision as to whether or not they

441. want to gain more the Republican Party.

442. One or two more.

443. By the way, I will say this.

444. I heard one or two more seats.

445. I heard

446. that a big lawsuit will be taking place is what will be taking place concerning the California hoax

447. where they're trying to get five more seats. And California is one of the most dishonest elections

448. ever. They send out tens of billions of ballots to people all over the place. Many of those people

449. get two or three ballots and they come back. California is a disgrace for voting.

450. And they're doing something that is very illegal.
