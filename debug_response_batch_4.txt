91. 我可以说，英国对BBC所作所为感到非常、非常尴尬。

92. 总统先生，您说过关税不会增加消费者价格，但现在您是更低的……

93. 我没说它们不会。我说在某些情况下可能会，但在很大程度上它们已被国家警告。

94. 举个例子，我们几乎没有通货膨胀。

95. 然而，我们已经收取了数亿美元。

96. 所以我们已经收取了数亿美元。

97. 我们曾用关税来停止战争。

98. 看看印度和巴基斯坦，看看我停止了多少战争，仅仅是说，我要

99. 反对关税，当你们来到你们的国家时，你们将不得不发动战争。

100. 所以关税战是最近的危机。

101. 在那种情况下，是核战争。

102. 我用你们的（关税）阻止了它。

103. 但很多时候，在很大程度上，国家自己承担了费用。

104. 公司们正在发生。

105. 我发现基于通货膨胀，我们几乎没有通货膨胀。

106. 当我从瞌睡乔·拜登手中接过这个国家时，通货膨胀，它是我们国家

107. 历史上最高的通货膨胀。

108. 至少48年。他们用了48年。我认为这是历史。

109. 我们没有，我们现在通货膨胀很低

110. 很快就会更低。但我们会让一些价格

111. 下降一点，这将使它们降到一个新的水平。

112. 美国人承担了多少时间？

113. 我认为非常少。

114. 我真的认为非常少。

115. 如果你看看，当我们加上我们国家

116. 赚取的数万亿美元时，

117. 当你加上我将要归还的事实，

118. 给中低收入人群每人约2000美元，

119. 除了富人，每个人都将得到2000美元。

120. 然后你把这个加进去。

91. I can say this, the UK is very, very embarrassed by BBC what they did.

92. Mr. President, you've said that tariffs do not increase prices for consumers, but now you're a lower...

93. I didn't say they don't. I say they may in some cases, but to a large extent they've been warned by the country.

94. As an example, we have virtually no inflation.

95. And yet we've taken in hundreds and millions of dollars.

96. So we've taken in hundreds of millions of dollars.

97. We've used tariffs to stop wars.

98. You look at India and Pakistan, look at so many wars I stopped just by saying, I'm going

99. to oppose tariffs when you come to your country, you're going to have to have war.

100. So a tariff war is a recent crisis.

101. In that case, it was nuclear war.

102. And I stopped it by using yours.

103. But oftentimes, at a large extent, the countries themselves pick up the tab.

104. The companies are coming to happen.

105. And I find that based on inflation, we have virtually no inflation.

106. When I inherited the country from Sleepy Joe Biden, the inflation, it was the highest

107. inflation in the history of our country.

108. at least 48 years. They used 48. I think it was the history.

109. We don't have, we have now a low inflation

110. going to be very soon even lower. But we'll get some of the prices

111. down a little bit, which will bring them down to a new level.

112. How much of the time have you been picked up by Americans?

113. I think very little.

114. I mean, I really think very little.

115. If you look at it, and when you add the trillions of dollars

116. that our country is making,

117. when you add the fact that I'll be giving back,

118. $2,000 or so to middle-income people, low-income people,

119. everybody but the rich will be giving $2,000 back.

120. And you add that in.
