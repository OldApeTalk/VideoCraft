【31】这可真是件很特别的事。

【32】我特意指出，直到去年

【33】那些16岁以上的寄宿家庭服务

【34】才移交给了新的监管机构。

【35】所以，审计署接管了

【36】去年是第一次全面监管所有这些地方。

【37】在此之前，它们是不受监管的。

【38】所以，有很多年轻人经历过

【39】人生中可怕的、难以想象的挑战

【40】而你在照顾他们，你的组织在照顾他们

【41】当然，当他们外出，当他们放学回家，

【42】当他们做普通青少年做的事情，比如见朋友等等，

【43】他们很容易受到这些团伙的侵害。

【44】是的，绝对是。

【45】我认为这一点很重要，

【46】你知道，我们与许多年轻人打交道

【47】他们遭受性剥削。

【48】你知道，我们曾多次处于几个

【49】非常引人注目的诱骗团伙的中心，在那里我们

【50】我们收留并管理了这些年轻人，但是

【51】我们是一个非常注重疗愈的环境，所以我们努力让这些年轻人

【52】能够

【53】重拾生活，找到稳定并继续前进

【54】所以，你最不希望看到的就是任何人

【55】与这些团伙有任何瓜葛的人出现在你的门口附近

【56】但请告诉我们发生了什么

【57】是的，我想你也得放眼大局，彼得，如果你看看所有的护理部门，包括国民医疗服务体系，今天有一个全国性的危机，那就是我们严重缺乏愿意在护理部门工作的人。

【58】招聘和留住人才是当前面临的最大危机。

【59】所以这增加了挑战，不是吗？

【60】那就是当组织急需人手来这里工作时，

【31】That's quite a particular thing.

【32】I make a point that only last year

【33】did that leaving care element of it for 16 plus

【34】pass into a new regulatory body.

【35】So Ofsted took over

【36】for the first time ever last year in terms of regulating all of those places previously.

【37】They were unregulated.

【38】So you've got quite a number of young people who've been through

【39】horrendous, unimaginable challenges

【40】in life and you're looking after them, your organisation looks after them

【41】and they of course, when they're out and about, when they're coming back from school,

【42】when they're doing what ordinary teenagers do, seeing their friends and so on,

【43】they're vulnerable to these gangs.

【44】Yeah, absolutely.

【45】I think it's important to note there that,

【46】you know, we work with a lot of young people

【47】who are at sexual exploitation.

【48】And, you know, we've been right at the centre of quite a few

【49】quite high profile grooming gangs where we've

【50】we've accommodated and we've managed those young people but

【51】we're very much a therapeutic environment so we try to enable those young people

【52】to

【53】get their life back and find stability and move on

【54】so the last thing you want then is anybody who has

【55】anything to do with these gangs to be anywhere near your front door

【56】but tell us what has happened

【57】Yeah, I think you've got to put in a context as well, Peter, that if you looked across all of the CURSE sector, including the NHS, there is a national crisis today that we are significantly short of people who want to work in the CURSE sector.

【58】Recruitment and retention is actually the biggest crisis that faces it at the moment.

【59】And so that increases the challenge, isn't it?

【60】That when organizations are desperate for people to work in this place,
