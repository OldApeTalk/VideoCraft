31. 但在这个国家，它们不像番茄和香蕉那样有竞争力。

32. 我们这个国家不生产这些。

33. 因此，我们的产业或食品没有受到保护。

34. 所以我们要做的就是削减

35. 我们会看到价格进一步下降。

36. 你们必须明白，我们都饱受了拜登危机的苦，

37. 那时的物价远高于现在。

38. 但我将能够让它们进一步降低，

39. 或者至少再低一点，在某些情况下，可能低很多。

40. 未来是更多的“增长回归”，还是您的关税政策？

41. 更多？真的吗？

42. 未来会有更多的“增长回归”吗？

43. 还是你们在关税方面会做些别的改变？

44. 我认为没有必要。

45. 我们刚刚对一些食品进行了一些小幅度的调整，

46. 比如咖啡，

47. 咖啡的价格本来会很高。

48. 现在它们会在很短的时间内降到低位。

49. 他们在这方面很在行。

50. 问题是我们继承的国家

51. 在1月20日就职了，

52. 国家的物价在那时已真的上涨。

53. 所以它们上涨了30%、40%、50%。

54. 而我们已经把它们降低了30%。

55. 这意味着它们仍然比过去高。

56. 我们有过很棒的四年，我认为这次会更好。

57. 在可负担性方面，“可负担”对民主党来说不是个好词。

58. 对我们来说是个好词，因为我们的物价远低于他们，而且肯定会远低于

59. 远低于民主党执政时期。

60. 总统先生，我的报纸是“电报”。

31. But they're not competitive in this country, like tomatoes and bananas and things.

32. We don't make them in this country.

33. So there's no protection of our industries or our food products.

34. So what we're going to do is we cut back

35. We'll see prices come down even lower.

36. You have to understand we've all suffered from the Biden crisis,

37. which were much higher than they are right now.

38. But I'll be able to get them down even lower,

39. or at least a little bit more, possibly in some cases, a lot lower.

40. More growbacks in the future or with your tariff policies?

41. More really?

42. Will there be more growbacks in the future

43. or will you change anything else with tariffs?

44. I don't think it would be necessary.

45. We just did a little bit of a rollback on some foods,

46. like coffee as an example,

47. where the prices of coffee are going to be high.

48. Now they'll be on the low side in a very short period.

49. They're very good at this.

50. The problem is we inherited a country

51. which took over January 20th,

52. where the prices were truly rose.

53. So they were up 30, 40, 50%.

54. And we got them down 30%.

55. That means they're still higher than where they were.

56. We had a great four years, and I think this is going to be even much better.

57. And in terms of affordability, it's not a good word for the Democrats.

58. It's a good word for us because our prices are much lower and will certainly be much, much lower than

59. than they were under the Democrats.

60. Mr. President, my newspaper that's telegraphed.
